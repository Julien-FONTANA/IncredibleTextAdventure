# IncredibleTextAdventure

## What is IncredibleTextAdventure ?
IncredibleTextAdventure (ITA) is a project for a "text based game" engine I'm making for fun.
Even if I only discovered text-based with internet, these first video games ever facinated me.
You had to immagine everything ! How wonderful...

## Why C# ? What Have I used ?
C# 4.7.2 is the core of the project. DI is done with Ninject.
And everything you'll see will respect the SOLID princliple !

## Can I clone / create PR on this repo ?
Sure, I'll be honored !
