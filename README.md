# IncredibleTextAdventure

## What is IncredibleTextAdventure?
IncredibleTextAdventure (ITA) is a project for a "text-based game" engine I'm making for fun.\
Even if I only discovered text-based with internet, these first video games ever fascinated me.\
Here is a link to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game \
You had to imagine everything! How wonderful...

## Why C#? What Have I used?
C# 4.7.2 is the core of the project. Dependency Injection is done with Ninject.\
And everything you'll see will respect the SOLID principles and the clean-code principle.

## Can I clone / create PR on this repo?
Sure, I'll be honored!

## I found a bug / typo / I want to add something...
Go on! Fork this repository, work with it, and make a pull-request.\
I'll review it and give you a feedback. If it's good enough, I'll merge it with the project!

## I have no idea how this works! What is Dependency Injection? 
You'll notice that I very rarely use object's constructor directly. Instead, I rely on Ninject to do what is known as Dependency Injection, which allows for object to be dynamically loaded into their interfaces. \

## What is "clean-code" ? What are the SOLID principles ?
I'm a craftsman. I take pride in my work, I do my best to have accessible, readable, maintainable code that always compile. \
Function names are to be unique, property are to be protected accordingly, everything have to be interfaced, but in the end this code is easy to get into! \

Have fun !
